<!-- 
  The main display that shows the information in 3 sections
  1) A top level banner with demo header
  2) A middle section with an svg image where the information
     received is drawn on the shelf in differing colors.  
     By coloring the information differently on the shelves, 
     a human-user can quickly perceive what is occurring.
  3) A bottom section with tables that give the textual 
     representation of received data so a human-user can 
     read any additional information as needed.
